# Texture shading

> Texture shading is a new technique for generating shaded relief images to show the three-dimensional structure of mountainous terrain. It differs from traditional hillshading and can be used either as an alternative shading method, or as an enhancement to hillshading by combining the two methods. Texture shading emphasizes the drainage network (canyons and ridges) of the landscape and exhibits a visual hierarchy that reflects this structure. It can be used to bring out fine details that are present in high-quality elevation data, and likewise as a tool to examine digital elevation models for unwanted data artifacts.

## Process

```bash

#################
# Process DEM using texture_shade
#
# This process requires a huge amount of memory, for the 8M geographx DEM it requires around 100GB of free memory
# This process has been tested on a AWS R5D with 32VCPUs and 256GB of ram, starting with a base AWS centos image

# Store the result back in s3

aws s3 cp Geographx-NZ-DEM-FLT.detail_1.contrast_1.5.lzw.tiff s3://linz-basemaps-source/Geographx-NZ-DEM-FLT/
```

Once complete this gives a uint16 tiff that has values between 0-65,536 to make this image usage a color ramp is applied to create a semi transparent image

At 0 create a 25% opacity black, `rgba(0,0,0,0.25)` then slowly ramp to 0% opacity at 32,768

```
nv       0       0       0       0
0        0       0       0       63
32768    0       0       0       0
```

Using gdal apply the color-relief

```bash
gdaldem color-relief \
    -co COMPRESS=lzw \
    -co TILED=yes \
    -co NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS \
    -of GTiff \
    -co BIGTIFF=yes \
    -co ALPHA=yes -alpha \
    Geographx-NZ-DEM-FLT.detail_1.contrast_1.5.lzw.tiff color.ramp Geographx-NZ-DEM-FLT.detail_1.contrast_1.5.lzw.ramp.tiff
```
