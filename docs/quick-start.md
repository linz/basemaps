# Quick start guide

This document is broken down into three user types: User, Operator and Developer.

- **User** wants to use the basemaps service running on [https://basemaps.linz.govt.nz](https://basemaps.linz.govt.nz)
- **Operator** wants to use `@basemaps/server` or `@linzjs/lambda-tiler` on their own imagery
- **Developer** wants to modify the linz/basemaps source code to meet their needs.

There are three separate quick start guides for these users.

- [User Quick Start](./user-guide/quick-start.md)
- [Operator Quick Start](./operator-guide/quick-start.md)
- [Developer Quick Start](./developer-guide/quick-startm.md)
