    === "`IMAGERY_DIR`"

        The path to the root folder of your GeoTIFF file collection.
            
        ```bash
        $IMAGERY_DIR = {path_to_imagery_directory}
        ```

## Run the `basemaps/server` package

        The path to the **bin** folder of the **basemaps/server** package.
            
        ```bash
