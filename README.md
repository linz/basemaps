A digital basemap provides a consistent background detail necessary to orient location and add to aesthetic appeal. Basemaps can be made up of streets, parcels, boundaries (country, regional, and city boundaries), shaded relief of a digital elevation model, waterways, hydrography, aerial and satellite imagery. Basemaps can be used as desktop, website or mobile phone application components, or as a 3rd party layers within a GIS or desktop mapping application.

## Deployment

Deployments of Basemaps are managed with github actions.

To trigger a deployment, make sure your branch is up to date and run the version bump script [./scripts/version.bump.sh](./scripts/version.bump.sh)
This script will create a `release:` commit and branch, please review the commit then create a pull request from it.

Once the release pull request is merged the CI system will deploy the released version into dev then into production.

## Deployment Rollback

when a Deployment Breaks Badly, don't try to fix that on the fly, this risk of introducing more errors and downtime. The fastest way is to rollback to previous release immediately and fix the problem before next release.

As Basemaps deployments are managed with github actions, every release will bundle the release packages and deployment in the github action automatically. So, it is very simple for use to roll back to previous release as all the previous deployment are remained in the github actions history. Please use the following steps to trigger a deployment roll when needed.

- On the main page of the repository, above the file list, click :clock4: commits
- To navigate to the previous release commit, click the tick mark to see all the previous github actions for this commit.
- Select `Build / deploy-prod (push)` workflow and rerun the it to roll back to previous release.
