A digital basemap provides a consistent background detail necessary to orient location and add to aesthetic appeal. Basemaps can be made up of streets, parcels, boundaries (country, regional, and city boundaries), shaded relief of a digital elevation model, waterways, hydrography, aerial and satellite imagery. Basemaps can be used as desktop, website or mobile phone application components, or as a 3rd party layers within a GIS or desktop mapping application.
